This assignment covers key deep learning concepts using TensorFlow. There are three primary tasks involved: 

Tensor Reshaping and Manipulations: In order to demonstrate broadcasting, I played around with the rank and shape of multi-dimensional tensors, reshaped them, and joined a smaller tensor to a larger one. This part provided a strong understanding of the flow and transformation of data in neural networks. 

Loss Functions and Hyperparameter Tuning Two prediction outputs were compared using two commonly used loss functions, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Categorical Crossentropy (CCE). In order to better understand these functions' impact during model training, I used bar plot visualization to look at how they react to different prediction accuracies. 
TensorBoard logging in conjunction with neural network training: Following neural network training on the MNIST dataset, I utilized TensorBoard to log the training metrics. This provided visual data regarding model accuracy, validation performance, and the use of loss/accuracy curves to detect overfitting. 

All things considered, this assignment combined practical TensorFlow coding with theoretical understanding, visualization, and model evaluation techniquesâ€”all essential skills for deep learning and machine learning projects.
